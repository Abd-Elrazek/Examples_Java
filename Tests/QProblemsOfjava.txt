The problems That faced me during training Java :

++ Why when I pass numbers in constructors or pass through method , the compiler tell me \ you can't convert from int to byte and already I defined the attribute as byte ? 
so I had to cast them to byte again.

public class Test{
    
  public static void main (String args[]){
		Employe e = new Employe();
		Manager m = new Manager();
	


	e.setEmploye("Ahmed", 33, new BirthDate(1, 2, 1991));
		print(e.toString()); // 
		m = new Manager();
        m.setEmploye("Mahmoud", 22 , new BirthDate(3, 8, 1993));
		m.Department = "Sales";
		print(m.toString());

    }
	
	
	public static <T> void print (T t){
	   System.out.println(t);
	}
}
